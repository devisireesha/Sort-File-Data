# Sort-File-Data
### Steps involves:
1. Create a new file.
2. Write the data to be sorted. This data will be entered by the user via the console and will then be copied to the file we created.
3. Once the data is entered into the file, use a `BufferedReader` to read the data and sort it alphabetically.
4. Write the sorted data to a file and display the output on the console.
